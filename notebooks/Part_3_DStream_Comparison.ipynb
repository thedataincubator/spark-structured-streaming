    "# Comparing Structured Streaming with DStream\n",
    "<!-- We'll compare the Spark Structured Streaming and legacy DStream APIs to discuss their syntactic as well as semantic differences, and their relative strengths and weaknesses. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The old Spark streaming API used discretized streams or DStreams.  The model was that rather than a single, ever-growing dataset, a discretized stream provided an RDD at each trigger.  In a sense, it was a series of discretized batch operations.\n",

    "<!--- Images from http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html --->\n",
    "\n",
    "The model had several drawbacks:\n",
    "1. DStream made it hard to deal with late or out-of-order data because the DStream was just discretized batches so it was difficult to update an old batch.\n",
    "1. The API for DStream was very different from the API for RDDs because their underlying data model was different.\n",
    "1. The streaming followed-by batch semantics made reliability hard.  If one step failed, the semantics of rerunning were unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it is still more built out than Structured Streaming and the API has feature support.  DStream will play a role in your streaming Spark applications for the foreseeable future."

    "# Benefits of Spark Tungsten\n",
    "<!-- One of the benefits of Structured Streaming is that it takes advantage of recent low-level Spark optimizations.  We'll explain what these are in this segment. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen the surface-level API differences between DStream and Structured Streaming. There are also many differences under the hood.  These have been added as newer versions of Spark for Datasets and Structured Streaming and are sometimes retrofitted to RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark has traditionally been focused on optimizing for inter-computer network IO Efficiency.  This was the major bottleneck in MapReduce and other traditional distributed computing systems.  At this point, Spark is now intra-computer memory- and CPU-bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customized Memory Management:** Spark understands its own memory allocation needs better than the generic JVM garbage collector.  Tungsten takes advantage of this by using `sun.misc.Unsafe`, which exposes C-Style off-heap memory access.  The result is fewer unnecessary garbage collection events and improved performance.\n",
    "1. **Binary Encoding:** While Spark traditionally needed to serialize data to JVM objects, it now uses the Tungsten binary encoding.  This has two major advantages.  First, it decreases the memory footprint.  While \"ABCD\" would take 4 bytes of UTF-8 to encode, it would be stored using 48 bytes as a JVM object.  Second, instead of serializing into objects, it's able to perform many actions directly on the the raw binary encoding, reducing the computational overhead for serialization / deserialization.\n",
    "1. **Code Generation:** Spark historically used generic JVM function evaluation.  Given the virtual function lookups, automated boxing of primitive types, and other JVM overhead, this dramatically slows down the computation.  By using type information, Tungsten is able to generate byte code and speed up performance.\n",
    "1. **Cache-aware Computation:** Tungsten lays out its memory in a way that takes advantage of CPU cache locality to reduce cache spilling and speed up computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, check out [this blog post](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/28/project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal.html) or [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/SparkSummit/deep-dive-into-project-tungsten-josh-rosen)."
